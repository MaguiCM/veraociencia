# Rasa Chatbot
Use the official [Rasa Open Source](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/) documentation for more detailed and accurate information.
## Installation
To install on Windows, Linux, or Mac, use the information available in [Rasa installation](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/installation/environment-set-up/).

To simplify, we used the Conda and installed it in a virtual environment, so first open Anaconda, go to Environments, and open "veraociencia" in a terminal.

## First steps
Create a new folder called rasa:
```bash
mkdir rasa
```
Enter in the following folder:
```bash
cd rasa
```
Create a new model:
```bash
rasa init
```
Try to have a conversation with your chatbot.

After opening the VS Code, open the new folder.

## Useful commands
Train a new model based on the last changes made:
```bash
rasa train
```

Run the chatbot using the command terminal:
```bash
rasa shell
```

Run the chatbot using the interface:
```bash
rasa run -m models --enable-api --cors "*"
```

Run custom actions (must be run in a new terminal):
```bash
rasa run actions
```

Validate the modifications made to the code and check for any errors before training occurs:
```bash
rasa data validate
```

Run the chatbot in debug mode and check each action it performs:
```bash
rasa interactive 
```
Restart the conversation:
```bash
/restart
```

Leave the conversation:
```bash
/exit
```
